# Cosmetic

- Generate properly indented C code
- Debugging: map IR labels to source labels
  (Could be as simple as emitting a comment?)

# Functionality/bugs

- Port IPC to compiler / RTS
- Improved correctness: use TNFA/TDFA simulator in Interpreter instead of
  regex-posix?
- implement `#n` (1.18), currently disabled in bsd.sh
- Ranges with 0 address (GNU extension). Very similar to 1,<> but allows the
  end address to match on the first line (or something).
  * Also apply appropriately to change-range special case...
  * And reconcile with the pre-first line feature

- Change and !:

  '8,9!chello': replaces *each* line with hello except line 8 and 9
  (are negated ranges even implemented?)

  a positive range such as 8,9chello replaces both lines with a single hello

- D/P (PrintFirstLine and DeleteFirstLine) are parsed but unimplemented?
  - tested by gnused's uniq.sed
  - commented-out test cases in bsd.sh too
  - now that pattern space is exposed to IR, we can use a regexp replace for it


# Testing

* Add some testing of regex matching, e.g. comparing regex-posix, TNFA and TDFA.
* Add tests for IPC functionality
* Add mode for bsd.sh that compares interpreted to compiled
  - Or just record known-good outputs for every test...
  - And move that into sedness

# Optimizations

## "Advanced"

* Use knowledge of regex to eliminate useless next-match calls
  - anchored at start: can't match again
  - anchored at end: first match will contain the end of the string
  - matches any suffix / ends with .*: first match will match all
* Track matched regexes until pattern space changes, check for equivalent
  regexes as well as impossible matches.
* Combine multiple regexes into a "switch" thing whenever there are multiple
  branches on matches.

## String operations

- Optimize out concatenation of empty strings
- Deduplicate substrings in substitutions
- If we have explict append sequences, find adjacent substrings, e.g. in
  `s/.../\1\2\3bar/` you can use a single substring including the prefix of the
  string up to the end of \3, instead of splitting it up before appending.
- Optimize out IsEmptyString used by case conversion
  Perhaps only practical on literals?
  Optimizing on regex submatches in general would be useful, but requires more
  information about the parsed regex to figure out the length of a group.
- Precalculate length of append lists to avoid repeated reallocs

## Regex

* Strip out failed states
  1. Identify failed states using minLength
  2. Remove all transitions to failed states
  3. Remove failed states themselves (unless that happens automatically when
     they are not mentioned and have no transitions?)
* Recognize literals and emit special code (or at least make TNFA/TDFA stuff
  faster - the madding gnused test is quite slow)
* TNFA minimization - might make TDFA generation faster
* TDFA minimization - combine equivalent states
* More efficient searching:
  - Fancy: something with the start-of-match tag - "abandon" states where the
    start of match tag is already set but would be moved forward. Prototype in
    SimulateTNFA, then see if the logic can be ported to the TDFA construction?
  - Simpler: in cases where we don't emit tags at all the location/length of the
    match would not be relevant so we can exit with a match on the first final
    state and can look for e.g. ".*re".
    This seemed to be a bit slower though. I think because there's no support
    for non-greedy .* and returning shortest instead of longest match.

* Don't use start/end tags for anchored regexes
  On a higher level than regex compilation - by replacing tag references with
  0/end of string in substrings, the tags will end up unused and the regular
  optimizations apply.

### Done

* Return bool from match functions, remove `match_t::result`
* Track used groups in matches, feed back to regex compiler
* Skip retry if the regex is anchored at the start
* Parts of minLength optimization:
  - Split up state entry point to have one without range check
  - When transitioning to a state with a lower minLength, skip check
  - Precalculate minLength and store in TDFA

### Abandoned

* Port search with states as in SimulateTNFA to TDFA construction
  - Turns out this was wrong. Can it even work? Let's just do the other
    optimizations :)
